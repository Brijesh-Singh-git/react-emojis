# react-emojis

> :rocket: :hamster: :tada: Render all current emojis with proper accessibility markup, on any size

[![MIT Licence](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/dreamyguy/react-emojis/blob/master/LICENSE)

Use **react-emojis** to output the recommended markup for accessible emojis:

```javascript
<Emoji emoji="woman-dancing"/>
```

...outputs:


```html
<span role="img" aria-label="woman dancing" class="react-emojis" style="line-height: 1;">ðŸ’ƒ</span>
```

## Install as a 'npm' package

**react-emojis** is also available as a package on `npm` and can be installed as a depedency with:

    npm i react-emojis --save

More documentation coming soon!

## Development

### Getting started

Clone this repo locally. You'll need to have [NodeJS][1] installed. Install all dependencies by running:

    npm i

### Run it locally

To start the app locally, run:

    npm run start

This command fires up the application on port `9900`, making it visible on http://localhost:9900. Because this app is based on [create-react-app][3], the port number should be configured on the [.env](https://github.com/dreamyguy/react-emojis/blob/master/.env#L1) file.

### Building the frontend for Production

When you're ready to build for production, run:

     npm run build

This command compiles all production-optimised resources to a folder called **build**. It's meant to be run remotely, at the environment host, at build time.

### About

**react-emojis** was conceived and developed by [Wallace SidhrÃ©e][1]. is written in [React][4]. It was initialized through [create-react-app 2][6] and built upon that with some sensible strategies. [Jest][7] is used for tests. [VS Code][12] was used as the IDE of choice.

# Auto-generated by CRA

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:9900](http://localhost:9900) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
